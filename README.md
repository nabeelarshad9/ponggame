This is a simple implementation of the classic Pong game using Python and Pygame.

Components Used
Python: The programming language used for development.
Pygame: The library used for creating the game, handling graphics, and user inputs.
Random Module: Utilized for generating random numbers for the boost positions.
Fonts: Various fonts are used for displaying text on the screen.
Game Loop: Implemented using a while loop to continually update the game state and render frames.
Sprites: Paddle, ball, and boosts serve as the main sprites used in the game.
Event Handling: Used to capture events such as quitting the game.
Collision Detection: Implemented for ball-paddle collision and ball-boost collision.
Scoring System: Keeps track of the player's score.
Graphics: Draws various shapes and text on the game screen using Pygame functions.
Game Over Screen: Displayed when the game ends.

How to Run
To run the game, ensure you have Python and Pygame installed. Then simply execute the "simple pong.py" script on any IDE.

Controls
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the paddle.
Try to keep the ball bouncing and earn points by hitting the ball with the paddle.
Avoid letting the ball fall below the paddle to prevent the game from ending.
